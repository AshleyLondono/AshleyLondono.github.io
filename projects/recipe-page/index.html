            This the best appetizer you can make! Think of it 
            like a rolled up manaeesh except the bread is a fluffy 
            and pillowy dinner roll dough. It's cheesy and packed 
            with so much flavor from the zaatar. Let's make them!

                thaw and rise in a warm place which can take anywhere from 
                3 to 5 hours. You can also do this the night before.
            </li>
                <br>
            <li>
                In one bowl, combine mozzarella cheese with feta cheese 
                and parmesan. Set aside.
            </li>
                <br>

                Tightly roll it up and place on a baking tray lined with 
                parchment paper, seam side down. Repeat with the rest.
