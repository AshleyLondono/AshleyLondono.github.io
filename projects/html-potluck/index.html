        <h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
        <p>
            Arcane season 2 is a Netflix animated series set in the League
            of Legends universe by Riot Games. The plot follows sisters Vi 
            (Hailee Steinfeld) and Jinx (Ella Purnell) as they fight on 
            opposite sides of a war between magic technologies and conflicting 
            beliefs in the twin cities of Piltover and Zaun.
        </p>
        <p>
            The season will continue the story from the explosive ending 
            of season one, which left many plot threads unresolved. For 
            example, the Council votes to give Zaun independence, but 
            Jinx's traumatized rocket strike on the building may disrupt 
            the vote. Additionally, Silco's death has left Zaun without 
            a leader, and it's unclear who will take over.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arcane is known for its captivating story, rich world-building, 
            and stunning animation. Season 2 is expected to stream on Netflix 
            in November 2024.
