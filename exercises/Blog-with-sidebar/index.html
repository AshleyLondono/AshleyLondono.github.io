                    The pawpaw tree (Asimina triloba) is a large shrub or 
                    small tree that can grow up to 35 feet tall and 12 inches 
                    in diameter. It has a broad crown and slender trunk, and 
                    its leaves are large, shiny, and dark green with a 
                    tropical appearance. The leaves are alternate, simple, 
                    and spirally arranged, and can grow up to a foot long and 
                    five inches wide. They are broadest above the middle, with 
                    smooth margins and pointed tips, and have a whitish 
                    coating on the upper surface and rusty hairs on the 
                    underside. The leaves are aromatic and smell like bell 
                    pepper, and they can turn yellow or golden brown in the 
                    fall.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pawpaw grows in full sun as an adult tree 
                    (especially with supplemental irrigation, 
                    as is found in Pawpaw orchards) to full shade 
                    (as an understory tree under high-branched large trees) 
                    and is found in zones 5 to 8.
                </p>
                <h3>Fruit Taste</h3>
                <p>
                    Some describe the flavor as bright, vibrant, and tropical, 
                    with a mix of mango, banana, berries, pineapple, and 
                    passion fruit. Others say it has a yeasty, floral 
                    aftertaste similar to unfiltered wheat beer.
                    Pawpaws have soft, pale yellow flesh that can be jelly-like.
                     Their common names include "poor man's banana," 
                     "American custard apple," and "Kentucky banana" because 
                     of their flavor and texture, which make them a good 
                     substitute for bananas in recipes.
                     Pawpaws have waxy, green skin that turns black as the 
                     fruit ripens, and large, glossy, dark brown seeds that 
                     are toxic to humans.

                    The Dwarf Red Banana Tree has wide leaves that offer 
                    great shade. You can create your own private jungle! 
                    You'll notice the Dwarf Red Banana Tree blooming in 
                    mid-summer. It's always a treat watch its yellow-green 
                    bananas grow in and turn redder as it reaches maturity.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Red Dwarf banana trees thrive in USDA 
                    hardiness zones 9-11. These zones provide the warm 
                    temperatures and humidity that banana trees need for 
                    optimal growth. In cooler climates, they can be grown 
                    in containers and brought indoors during the colder months.

                    The Red Dwarf banana, also known as the Dwarf Red banana, 
                    offers a unique and delightful flavor profile characterized 
                    by its exceptional sweetness and subtle tropical 
                    fruitiness. The creamy and smooth texture enhances its 
                    rich, indulgent taste, often described as having undertones 
                    of raspberry or mango. This exotic flavor combination makes 
                    the Red Dwarf banana a favorite for fresh eating and 
                    various culinary applications, providing a distinct 
                    and enjoyable banana experience.

                    The Nikitski Ranni pomegranate is a Russian variety of 
                    pomegranate that is known for its sweet and tart flavor 
                    and large size. The fruit can grow up to 6 inches in 
                    diameter, has light pink skin, and red arils. The Nikitski 
                    Ranni pomegranate tree also produces bright orange flowers 
                    in the spring and is heat tolerant. The fruit is resistant 
                    to cracking and can be harvested between September 
                    and October.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Nikitski Ranni pomegranate tree can grow in USDA 
                    zones 6â€“10 and prefers full sun for best fruit production. 
                    It is self-fruitful, but planting a second tree nearby can 
                    increase production. When planting a Nikitski Ranni 
                    pomegranate tree, it is recommended to soak the roots 
                    for 30 minutes, plant immediately, and secure the plant 
                    in its pot with clear tape.

                <p>
                    Pomegranate is a fruit that is sweet and tart with a thick 
                    skin. The part of this fruit that you eat is the seeds 
                    since they contain juicy flavors. The pomegranate's flavor 
                    is sometimes compared to both grapes and cranberries. 
                    While it may look slightly different from other fruits, 
                    it is just as tasty.
