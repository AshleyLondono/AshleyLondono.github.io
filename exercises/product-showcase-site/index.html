                    A Nikon camera is a photographic device manufactured by 
                    Nikon Corporation, a Japanese multinational corporation 
                    headquartered in Tokyo. Nikon cameras are renowned for 
                    their quality, durability, and advanced technology. 
                    They come in various types, including:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        DSLR Cameras: Digital Single-Lens Reflex cameras use 
                        a mirror mechanism to provide an optical viewfinder, 
                        offering high image quality and versatility with 
                        interchangeable lenses. Popular models include the 
                        Nikon D850 and D7500.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mirrorless Cameras: These cameras do not use a mirror 
                        mechanism, allowing for a more compact design while 
                        still offering high image quality and interchangeable 
                        lenses. Examples include the Nikon Z6 and Z7 series.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Compact Cameras: Also known as point-and-shoot cameras, 
                        these are smaller, simpler cameras ideal for casual 
                        photography. Nikon's COOLPIX series is a well-known 
                        line of compact cameras.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Action Cameras: Designed for capturing fast-paced 
                        action and extreme sports, these cameras are rugged 
                        and often waterproof. The Nikon KeyMission series fits 
                        this category.
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Who uses them?</h3>
